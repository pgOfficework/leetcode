/*
The release of Java SE 17 introduced sealed classes (JEP 409).
This feature enables more fine-grained inheritance control in Java.

Sealing allows classes and interfaces to define their permitted subtypes.
In other words, a class or interface can define which classes can implement or extend it.
Itâ€™s a useful feature for domain modeling, and increasing the security of libraries.
